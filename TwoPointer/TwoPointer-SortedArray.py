'''
Two Pointer Algorithm (Sorted Array):
- Two pointers are used to iterate through a list or array(must be sorted).
- The two pointers are usually initialized to the first and last elements of the list/array.
- The pointers are then moved towards each other, comparing the elements they point to.
- The algorithm terminates when the pointers meet or cross each other.
